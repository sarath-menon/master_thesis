I need to create a storyboard showing the user experience for a feature in an app: The storyboard should tell the story of a persona utilizing their system and
reacting to it and include: persona (imaginary person with a real background,
needs, and opinions); problem (introduce a specific problem that the person
faces, one that arises often); solution (visualize and clearly shows how your idea
helps the person overcome the problem they face; payoff: describe how the
person feels and what they can do now that they couldnâ€™t before. 


The problem is: help people refresh old memories and generate new memories despite the distance.
The possible solutions include: 
1. Digital Storytelling: Use apps to create digital stories or videos that capture your relationship journey, including memories and future plans.
2. Virtual Date Ideas: Suggest creative virtual date options, like virtual museum tours or cooking classes.

Give a detailed storyboard description make sure that is satisfies the following properties:  

1. Visualizes user interactions clearly
2. Enhances communication about user needs
3. Organizes user journey steps
4. Saves time in identifying user pain points
5. Identifies potential friction in user experiences
6. Improves collaboration on user-focused solutions
7. Guides the development of user-centric features
8. Increases empathy for user personas
9. Supports decision-making based on user behavior insights
10. Clarifies sequence of user actions

Create a 6-panel storyboard in comic style. For each panel:
1. Describe the user's specific actions and interactions.
2. Detail the user's emotions and reactions.
3. Keep descriptions under 50 words.
4. Use simple, clear language.
5. Avoid technical terms or jargon.
6. Focus on one key moment or interaction per panel.
Ensure the panels flow logically to tell a complete story of the user's experience with the app feature.
